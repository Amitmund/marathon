## Changes from 0.8.1 to 0.8.2

#### New health check option `ignoreHttp1xx`

When set to true, the health check for the given app will ignore HTTP
response codes 100 to 199, in contrast to considering it as unhealthy. With this unbounded task startup times can be handled: the tasks are neither
healthy nor unhealthy as long as e.g. "100 - continue" is returned.

#### HTTPS support for health checks

Health checks now work with HTTPS.

## Changes from 0.8.0 to 0.8.1

#### New option `dryRun` on endpoint `PUT /v2/groups/{id}`

When sending a group definition to this endpoint with `dryRun=true`,
it will return the deployment steps Marathon would execute to deploy
this group.

#### New endpoint POST `/v2/tasks/delete`

Takes a JSON object containing an array of task ids and kills them.
If `?scale=true` the tasks will not be restarted and the `instances`
field of the affected apps will be adjusted.

#### POST `/v2/apps` rejects existing ids

If an app with an already existing id is posted to this endpoint,
it will now be rejected

#### PUT `/v2/apps/{id}` always returns deployment info

In versions <= 0.8.0 it used to return the complete app definition
if the resource didn't exist before. To be consistent in the response,
it has been changed to always return the deployment info instead. However
it still return a `201 - Created` if the resource didn't exist.

#### GET `/v2/queue` includes delay

In 0.8.0 the queueing behavior has changed and the output of this endpoint
did not contain the delay field anymore. In 0.8.1 we re-added this field.
